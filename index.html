<div><b>Causes of Ugly Roof Stains</b></div>
<div><b><br></b></div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<div align="center"></div>
<div align="center">
<strong>ALGAE</strong> </div>
<div align="justify">
<div align="justify">Algae is a living organism that thrives on dust, pollen, and the organic materials that make up the roof. Dampness triggers its growth. Stains are usually more prominent on northern and western exposures and in heavily shaded areas. Algae grows on, under, and behind the tiny granules that cover the shingles and can harbor a number of molds. This results in unsightly stains and streaks on the roof. Roofs with algae stains absorb heat rather than refect it, resulting in a super-heated attic and higher home cooling costs as well as reducing the natural life span of the shingles.</div>
</div>

<p></p>
</div>

<div>
<div align="center">MOSS</div>
<div align="center">Thick moss growth with its shallow root system keeps the roofing materials damp for extended periods of time. This moisture promotes wood rot and causes erosion of the shingles. Moss typically starts to grow at the top of the vertical slots between the shingles. These areas of asphalt shingles are the last place water evaporates from a roof. Moss, like lichen colonies, is quite damaging to shingles and some of the granules underneath the moss be already be gone.</div>
</div>

<div align="center"><strong>LICHEN COLONIES</strong></div>

<div align="center">Lichens are a fungus, usually of the class Ascomycetes, that grow symbiotically with algae, resulting in a composite organism that characteristically forms a crust-like or branching growth on shingle granules.  Lichens put out root-like tentacles that penetrate deep into the shingle’s organic, oil base for nourishment, eventually ruining them by creating dark spots, or pock marks where they grow.</div>

<div><br></div>
</div>

<div>
<div>Most roof stains are caused by the growth of <b>algae</b> (which can harbor a number of <b>molds</b>), <b>lichen</b> colonies (<b>fungus</b>) or <b>moss</b> that feed on the organic material frequently found in the mineral-based granules that make up roofing. This organic matter is the food source for these roof staining organisms. These organisms are literally <b>eating &amp; wreaking</b> your roof. The portions of a roof that receive the least amount of sunlight are more likely to have algae, lichen colonies, or moss growth. This is why many homes may have roof stains only on one side of the roof, typically the northern and/or western exposure or in heavily shaded areas.</div>

<div align="center"><strong>Why Should I Have My Roof Cleaned?</strong></div>

<div align="center"><br></div>

<div>
<div>
<strong>Stop the damage </strong>that roof staining organisms are doing to your roof. These organisms, specifically algae, lichens, and moss are <strong>feeding off the organic material in your shingles</strong>. In other words, your shingles are their food source. The longer they are allowed to stay and feast off your shingles, the more damage they will cause.</div>
<div><br></div>
</div>

<div>
<div>Roof algae, lichens and/or moss can eat through your shingles and into your roof deck causing wood rot. When the wood rots, moisture gets in through the cracks and creates an environment hospitable to mold growth. And <strong>mold growth in a home can pose health risks to people and pets</strong>. Don’t ignore roof stains. With a roof cleaning costly roof repairs can be avoided BEFORE any permanent damage to your roof occurs. </div>
</div>

<div>
<div><br></div>
<div>A roof covered with alga, moss etc. is no longer able to efficiently reflect sunlight. The <strong>algae covered roof absorbs heat</strong>, thereby adding unwanted heat to your attic and <strong>increasing your cooling costs</strong>. Safely, gently, and completely removes the staining, restoring your roof back to its natural health and efficiency.</div>
</div>

<div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Having your roof cleaned by a professional is the <strong>cost saving alternative to premature re-roofing</strong>. There is absolutely no need to prematurely re-roof when your roof can look like new again for a fraction of replacement costs.</div>
</div>

<div>
<div><b><br></b></div>
<div>
<strong>Restore the beauty</strong> of your home. A dirty roof detracts from your home’s curb appeal. You clean your siding, porches, and walkways. You may even apply weed control and fertilizers to spruce up your lawn and garden. But if you ignore those ugly roof stains, no matter what else you do to improve your home’s exterior, those stains will be the main focal point of your home’s exterior. If you are hoping to sell your house, roof cleaning is a must!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
<strong>Your insurance company can cancel your  homeowners policy </strong>for having a dirty roof. Insurance companies are increasingly demanding that homeowners have their stained roofs cleaned. And they often only give a very short notice to do it. We’ve seen cases where the homeowner was given less than a week to comply or lose their insurance coverage.  That’s why it is SO VERY important to be proactive and have those roof stains professionally removed BEFORE you get that notice from your insurance company. Insurance companies know that untreated roof stains will negatively impact the overall integrity of the roof, which can also lead to mold growth INSIDE your home. Roof stains are seen as ‘risks’ that could cost them money in a claim.</div>
